# Debug Content Loss Issue - WebNote

## Current Status: Enhanced Debugging Added ‚úÖ

The application now has comprehensive debugging to track the content flow from typing to storage and back. Here's what was added:

### Server-Side Debugging (Terminal Logs):
- **Update Note**: Shows what data is being saved to MongoDB
- **Fetch Note**: Shows what data is being retrieved from MongoDB
- Data types and content lengths are logged

### Client-Side Debugging (Browser Console):
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Tracks the encryption process before sending to server
- **Content Changes**: Logs when user types and content changes
- **Auto-save Process**: Detailed logging of the 3-second auto-save
- **Note Loading**: Shows when notes are loaded from server

## Test Steps to Identify the Issue:

### 1. Login and Create/Edit a Note
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Login with Google OAuth
3. Create a new note or select an existing one
4. Type some content: **"This is my test content that should not vanish!"**
5. Wait for auto-save (3 seconds) - check console for logs
6. **Expected**: Auto-save logs show content being encrypted and sent to server

### 2. Test Note Switching
1. Create/select another note
2. Type different content: **"This is note 2 content"**  
3. Switch back to first note
4. **Expected**: First note content should be preserved and loaded from server

### 3. Test Page Refresh
1. With content in a note, refresh the page (F5)
2. Login again if needed
3. Select the same note
4. **Expected**: Content should be exactly as you left it

### 4. Test Logout/Login Cycle
1. Logout from the app
2. Login again with the same Google account
3. Check if notes and content are preserved
4. **Expected**: All notes and content should be intact

## Debugging Logs to Watch For:

### üîç Browser Console (F12 ‚Üí Console):
```
=== CLIENT UPDATE NOTE START ===
Auto-saving note data: {noteId: "...", title: "...", contentLength: 42}
=== CLIENT FETCH NOTE START ===
Content change detected: {previousLength: 0, newLength: 42, preview: "This is my test content..."}
```

### üîç Terminal (Server Logs):
```
=== NOTE UPDATE REQUEST ===
Title type: string Length: 15
Content type: string Length: 42
=== NOTE FETCH RESPONSE ===
Retrieved content type: string Length: 42
```

## Common Issues and Solutions:

### Issue 1: Content appears empty after refresh
**Cause**: Decryption failing or encryption keys not persisting
**Look for**: Decryption error logs, "object" instead of "string" types

### Issue 2: Content vanishes when switching notes  
**Cause**: Auto-save not completing before note switch
**Look for**: Missing auto-save completion logs

### Issue 3: Content lost on logout/login
**Cause**: Encryption keys changing between sessions
**Look for**: Different encryption salt values

## Current Safeguards Added:

‚úÖ **Empty content protection**: Won't save if both title and content are unexpectedly empty
‚úÖ **Enhanced content sync**: Better handling of server-to-editor content updates  
‚úÖ **Comprehensive logging**: Full visibility into the data flow
‚úÖ **Save-before-switch**: Automatically saves current note before switching
‚úÖ **beforeunload protection**: Warns user about unsaved changes

## Next Steps:

1. **Test the application** following the steps above
2. **Share the console logs** from both browser and terminal when content vanishes
3. **Note the exact scenario** where content disappears (switching notes, refresh, etc.)

The debugging will reveal exactly where in the process the content is getting lost!
